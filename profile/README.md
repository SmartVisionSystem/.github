# SmartVisionSystem

SmartVisionSystem (Smart Vision Systems Laboratory) is a research group focused on advancing computer vision, machine learning, and related technologies for real-world, multi-sensor applications. We develop algorithms and systems that integrate data from visible-range and thermal cameras, microphones, accelerometers, fNIRS devices, and various other sensors. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, we tackle practical challenges and push the boundaries of intelligent sensing, perception, and decision-making.

## Mission

- Develop advanced machine learning algorithms tailored for diverse sensor inputs, addressing challenges across a range of domains.
- Transform cutting-edge research innovations into practical, impactful applications—spanning surveillance, occupancy detection, UAV-based inspection, privacy preservation, and more.
- Collaborate with academia, industry, and government agencies to drive interdisciplinary solutions that meet emerging global needs.
- Mentor the next generation of scientists and engineers, ensuring readiness to excel in rapidly evolving fields of vision, embedded systems, and smart sensing.

## Research Areas

- **2D and 3D Smart Vision:** Integrating two-dimensional and three-dimensional visual data to enhance perception, mapping, and scene understanding.
- **Few-Shot Learning:** Enabling robust model performance with minimal training samples, reducing reliance on large labeled datasets.
- **Domain Transfer Learning:** Bridging gaps between different sensor modalities, environments, or conditions to create models that generalize across domains.
- **Multimodal Autonomous Driving:** Combining camera feeds, LiDAR, radar, GPS, and other sensor data to improve perception, decision-making, and navigation in autonomous vehicles.
- **Multi-Modal Sensing and Fusion:** Merging thermal, visible, inertial, and physiological sensor data for more comprehensive recognition, detection, and situational awareness.
- **Embedded and Mobile Vision:** Designing low-power, privacy-focused vision solutions that operate efficiently on edge devices, UAVs, and mobile platforms.
- **Advanced ML Architectures:** Employing deep learning, transformer-based models, and innovative training strategies for complex tasks such as detection, segmentation, and classification.
- **Human-Centric Applications:** Using visual and sensing technologies to assess cognitive workload, recognize behavioral patterns, and understand human emotional states, enabling richer human-machine interactions.
