## Research Areas

Our research explores multiple dimensions of computer vision and machine learning:

- **2D and 3D Smart Vision:** Enhancing perception and understanding through advanced algorithms that integrate both two-dimensional and three-dimensional visual data.
- **Few-Shot Learning:** Reducing dependence on large, labeled datasets by developing methods to learn robust models from limited samples.
- **Domain Transfer Learning:** Leveraging knowledge learned from one domain (e.g., sensor type, environment) to improve performance in another, enabling more adaptive and generalizable systems.
- **Multimodal Autonomous Driving:** Fusing data from cameras, LIDAR, radar, GPS, and other sensors to improve perception, decision-making, and control in autonomous vehicles.
- **Multi-Modal Sensing and Fusion:** Integrating thermal, visible, inertial, and physiological data streams to enhance recognition, detection, and situational awareness.
- **Embedded and Mobile Vision:** Designing low-power, privacy-preserving vision systems that run efficiently on embedded devices, UAVs, and edge hardware.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Architectures:** Employing deep neural networks, transformer-based architectures, and few-shot/fusion learning methods to tackle complex recognition, classification, and segmentation tasks.
- **Human-Centric Applications:** Using vision and sensing technologies to assess cognitive workload, human behavior, and emotional states, facilitating richer interaction and assistance.
